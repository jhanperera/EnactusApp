                <p>In short and sweet sense, Credit, is a simple agreement,
                  where the borrower promises to repay back the borrower at a later date.
                  As a benefit, the borrower would be able to buy anything they want with the borrowed money,
                  so as long as they return in the future! This is a serious advantage if you consider this:
                  You don’t need money now to enjoy that iPhone you’ve been wanting to buy for ages! Sounds simple right? </p>

                <p>A person’s credit rating is basically KING in Canada.
                  Why? A credit rating is a person’s reputation of repaying back the money owed.
                  Think about it—would you rather lend to a friend you know who will never pay you back,
                  or a family member that will? Credit rating tells institutions,
                  such as banks, if a person is probable to repay back any money loaned to them.</p>

                  and may not be trustworthy to loan money, and expect repayment. R0 is possible,
                  it just means the person does not have a credit rating.</p>
