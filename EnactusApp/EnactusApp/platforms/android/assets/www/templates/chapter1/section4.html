          Just as credit cards and the convenient use of Credit has been lovely, and becoming more frequently used, that ALSO means there is danger when one is not careful! For instance, the RCMP indicated from 2009 to 2010, there has been a 2.05% increase in the
          amount of Credit Card Frauds in Canada—and not to mention that there are more than 31.9 million credit cards in circulation in the country.<br /> Long story short, there are many ways to become a victim of a “Snake” when one acquires
          a credit card.

          The Case with RFID Credit Cards. Since becoming increasingly popular in 2016, RFID tags are used in Credit cards, allowing credit card users to tap on a credit card machine instead of manually entering a PIN. (Instead of looking very nervous in a line
          up, a simple tap and walk away!) While large purchases DO require a manual entry and signature from the credit card holder, there is still inherent danger in RFID tags in Credit cards—some can be read up to 30 feet away!

          Without going too technical, a very recent CBC news article revealed that someone with a reader can easily “bump” into a person with RFID Credit cards and steal all your information—there is even an android application that proves this vulnerability exists.
          <br /><br /> The best solution? Use aluminous foil and make special wallets, and be aware of your surroundings. RFID is wonderful technology (such as Amiibo’s used in Nintendo products) but there are always risks.

          <ion-item>1. Remember and protect your Credit Card PIN. (Personal Identification Number) Never tell anyone!</ion-item>
          <ion-item> 2. Be aware of phishing (pretending to be a “legit” cause or person) and NEVER give out your personal information. Examples include bank personnel who may call you, indicating your account has been “compromised” and require input.

          <ion-item>3. Never give information to a bank personnel unless you contacted them in the first place!</ion-item>

            4. Never leave credit cards (or your valuables!) somewhere not in your reach, unattended. This is especially true for students, who may feel the urge to leave their belongings in the library for a washroom break.

          <ion-item>1. It may be a good idea to not leave large amounts of cash at home. Without getting too in depth about inflation, it could be dangerous if someone knows there are substantial quantities left at home. Consider your bank as a place to put away
            your money.</ion-item>
          <ion-item>2. Be careful when it comes to signing agreements, such as loans, in general. There is fine-print, for example, what happens if there is a bankruptcy?</ion-item>
          <ion-item>3. This may sound obvious, but be careful when online shopping. Only enter personal information, including credit card information, to trusted sites.</ion-item>
