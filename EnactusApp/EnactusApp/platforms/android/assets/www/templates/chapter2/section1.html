                  <p>So you’re in high school now. Everyone around you is boasting about the latest clothes,
                  the coolest tech and the all the concerts and events they plan on going to. All of those
                  things come with a hefty financial burden and most high school students just like to spend
                  everything they have now without looking to the future. This section will teach you the basics
                  about saving money, preparing for unexpected costs and prioritizing where you should be
                  spending your money (Hint: You shouldn’t be spending it on an overpriced Jacket)</p>

                  <p>
                      The first step to creating an effective budget is knowing how much money
                      is going to be coming into your bank account. Most employers give out work schedules in advance so you have an
                      approximate idea of how much you will be making in a specific time period.

                  <h5>Step 2: Figure out your fixed and reoccurring Expenses</h5></br>

                <p>One thing you should keep in mind, going out to grab some pizza for lunch is not a fixed expense. 
                  A fixed/reoccurring expense is something that is needed for you to function for example your phone bill, 
                  groceries and even haircuts. If you are fortunate enough to have a car, gas and insurance would also be 
                  considered a fixed expense. Calculate your total monthly fixed expenses by adding them up and call it 
                  restricted cash. Subtract your restricted cash from your monthly income because these are the costs that you 
                  know for sure you will be incurring.</p>

                  <h5>Step 3: Allocating for Unexpected expenses/Emergencies</h5></br>

                  <p>
                      Since you are still young, you may not have to worry about too many unexpected expenses.
                       But as you grow older, this will become a very important part of your budget because you will 
                      own things that have much more value (such as a car) which increases risk of unexpected expenses. 
                      An unexpected expense is an expense you weren’t expecting on incurring (no way??). Typically, 
                      you should budget 5-10% of your budget left over after completing step 2 towards these expenses.

                  <p>
                      Saving for the future is essential and you should start now. Once you start, 
                      you won’t even notice the reduction in spending money because you will eventually 
                      get used to the reduced budget. Typically, it’s recommended that 30% of your budget 
                      left after step 3 be allocated towards a savings account you will never touch.

                  <p>
                      Having fun isn’t hard, when you’ve got a library card! Jokes aside, 
                      entertainment is a crucial part of keeping yourself happy. 
                      I’m going to show you that you don’t have to break the bank to have fun. 
                      After step 4, take the budget you have left and multiply by 35%. This will 
                      give you your entertainment budget. Keep in mind that you will reducing the percentage you 
                      multiply your leftover budget with as you make more income. If I had $2000 left over from step 4, 
                      I wouldn’t be allocating $700 to my monthly budget for entertainment as that is excessive.
