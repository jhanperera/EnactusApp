          To understand essentially HOW the numbers came to be, especially when it comes to paying and receiving interest, one must understand the math behind it.
          <br /><br /> Now I am aware math is not everyone’s strength, so this section will be a simple overview and some basic practice. Practice makes perfect, so please bear with me.
          <br /><br /> For our purposes, let’s focus on the two most common types of interest—simple and compound interest. Interest is the money paid or received at a rate and duration because of money borrowed/ borrowing.

        <h3>Why is there interest on loans?</h3> <br />
        <p>
          Money that is lent can be used for other purposes, such as being spent now, instead of being lent out. Because of this, most people who lend money request extra money, to compensate for this opportunity that is lost. Think of it as: “If I lend to you
          now, I could spend it instead—why should I lend to you?”

          Simple Interest is the interest based on the principal amount (the original amount of the loan) only. The formula for Simple Interest is Principal x Annual Rate x Time in Years*. The time in years is important—if the duration is in months, you will need
          to divide the number of months by 12 to determine the fraction of the year. For example, 6 months would represent half a year (6 months / 12 months = 50% or half). Similarly, 10 months would be 10/12 = roughly 0.833 of a year.

        <h3>Let’s try a basic example</h3><br />
        <p>
          Let’s assume Mary lends her friend Warren $1000, at an annual interest rate of 10% for 7 years. This is under simple interest. Using the formula:<br /><br /> Simple Interest= Principal x Annual Rate x Time in Years 10% = 0.10, time in years=
          7 and principal is 1000 SI= 1000 x 0.10 x 7 SI = $700<br /><br /> We see that Warren must pay back $700 in interest, IN ADDITION to the $1000 that Mary let her friend. (Do not forget to add back the principal amount to figure out how much is
          owed in total—the formula only gives you the “Extra stuff” of compensation, the interest, but not the total)

        <h3>Let’s try another example</h3><br />
        <p>
          Mr. Lemon’s Bank charges 15% interest per year on overdue accounts. <br /><br /> Mr. Orange has a bill of $94.00 that went overdue by one month. Under simple interest, how much does Mr. Orange owe the Bank of Mr. Lemon? Again, refer to the formula:
          Simple Interest= Principal x Annual Rate x Time in Years N= 1 month (again, please remember to convert: 1/ 12 = roughly 0.083)
          <br /><br /> Interest rate of 15%= 0.15 (15/100) Principal = $94 SI= 94 x 0.15 x 0.083 SI = $1.175
          <br /><br /> Rounded would be roughly $1.18. Would this be the final answer? Do you notice the problem here? The question is asking for how much is owed in total. We must add $1.18 with the principal= 1.18+94 = $95.18
          <br /><br /> We see that Mr. Orange owes $95.18 to Mr. Lemon’s Bank.

          Compound Interest is the most common form of interest you will find. Why is that? Because any person that uses compound interest will get more interest back… or pay more interest if they loaned any money! Compound interest calculates the interest based
          on the principal AND the interest earned.<br /><br /> In simple interest, the interest rate would only be applied to the original amount. This means now, under compound interest, there will be MORE because it is applying the rate to
          an amount GREATER than the original.<br /><br /> Think of it this way: Let’s say you accidentally ruined your favorite shirt with a big ketchup stain. Being lazy, you decide to not clean it up and leave it on in a closet. By not cleaning it
          sooner, the shirt gets worse significantly over time—it begins to smell, and bugs infest your closet. This is compound interest—over time, you end up owing more money/ earning more money because the interest stacks on top of the original amount
          AND the interest over time.

          The formula for Compound Interest is slightly more complicated. Just breeze, okay?<br /><br /> I’m gonna show it right now… 1…2..3….<br /><br /> FV=PV [(1+r/n)^(n x t)]<br /><br /> OKAY CALM DOWN. Let’s look into it. <br /><br /> FV refers to
          the future value, that is, how much this loan would be worth in the future. R refers to the annual interest rate, while n means the number of years the loan lasts. Finally, t is term your money is “tied” up in—basically how many times the interest
          will be “Stacked” upon. Naturally, PV means present value, how much the loan is worth now. In most cases PV would equal the principal.<br /><br />

          Let’s get a basic example. You invest $12,000 at 4% compounded yearly for 5 years. How much will you get back after 5 years? Using the not-so-scary formula…
          <br /><br /> FV=PV [(1+r/n)^(n x t)]<br /><br /> We know for sure the PV, which is $12,000. The interest rate, r, is 0.04. The n, number of years, is 5. And finally, compounded yearly means it is compounded once a year, which means t=1.
          <br /><br /> FV=12000 [(1+0.04/5)^(5 x 1)] **remember to watch for order of operations<br /> FV= 12000[ (1+0.008)^5]<br /> FV= 12000(1.040645)<br /> FV= roughly $12487.74<br /><br /> We see that with this investment, one could receive $12,487.74
