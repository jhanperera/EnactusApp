                  <p>It should come as no surprise that banks have many ways of making money, 
                    and collecting service charges on accounts is not the only way—in fact, 
                    it accounts for less than 10% of how banks make money! A significant portion comes from interest on loans, 
                    deposit boxes, other financial instruments (eg. Mutual funds, GIC), cheques and foreign exchange.</p>

                <p>With that being said, just as there are many types of ice-cream flavors to choose from, 
                  there are types of loans that people can obtain, depending on factors like what exactly is being bought, 
                  or the duration as well.</p>

              <div class="item item-text-wrap">
                <p>The most common and frequently discussed type of loan is the Credit Card. 
                  It is 30 days, no interest if the balance is paid off during the first 30 days, 
                  and then an interest rate that typically is equal to or greater than 20%. 
                  You may have heard of these companies, such as Visa, MasterCard or AMEX, 
                  however there are many credit card companies out there, especially ones outside of Canada. 
                  The best part often involves the rewards and benefits, such as a point system for usage and rewards.</p>

              <div class="item item-text-wrap">
                <p>A bank loan is another type of credit. It often has a term between 3-5 years, 
                  and depending on the type of bank loan provided by the bank, the interest rate could be different. 
                  These types of loans are ideal for buying appliances such as nice big mini fridge in your garage, 
                  electronics or even that purple IKEA sofa you’ve been eyeing for a while. </p>

                <p>Mortgages are a type of loan commonly for buildings, such as houses and office buildings. 
                  They tend to have longer terms than a normal bank loan, of 20-25 years, depending on the bank. 
                  But there’s more parts to a mortgage than just the principal amount, and the interest—there is 
                  also home insurance and taxes—even collateral—that is involved with a mortgage. It is often 
                  considered one of the largest amount of debts a person may take upon.</p>

                <p>Installment Loans are loans that require a set amount paid per month; 
                  the loan must be repaid in fixed amounts consistently over a period of time. 
                  The most common example, especially for future drivers, is a car loan, 
                  where it is typically giving a person an option to buy the car now or pay a 
                  certain down payment NOW and then a fixed amount for a period of time 
                  (eg. $10,000 now, and then $1000 per month for 8 years).</p>

                <p>Another interesting type of loan is a Demand Loan. Though very rare, 
                  this type of loan essentially involves the lender giving money to a borrower, 
                  but at any point in time, the lender can ask the borrower back for the money. 
                  The strangest part? No advance notice is needed; it just demanded by the lender, 
                  and the borrower MUST repay back then and there. This is extremely short-term.</p>

                <p>There are many different types of loans out there, offered from banks and other
